## Terms for learning Git
 * Repository - A collection of files
 * Git - Version Control - The process of keeping code of potentially many versions consistent.
 * Clone - A local copied version of a git repository
 * Fork - Copying a git repository to another git hub
 * History - A record of all that has happened to a git repository
 * Staging - Preparing changes made on a clone to be made in to a commit
 * Remote - a repository in cyberspace
 * Commit - a reference in a repositories history
 * Push - updating a remote to match the clone

## Steps to our Lamba School Git Flow
1. Fork repository
2. `git clone` w/ the repository URL
3. After Changes Made: `git status`
4. `git add <file-name>`
5. `git status` to check what is staged
6. `git commit -m 'made changes to the Readme'`
7. `git push`
